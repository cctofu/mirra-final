# Mirra — AI-Powered Consumer Persona Intelligence

Mirra is an AI-driven marketing intelligence platform that analyzes how different consumer personas respond to a product. It combines LLM reasoning (via Amazon Bedrock) with real persona data to simulate purchasing behavior, classify consumer archetypes, and generate actionable marketing insights.

### Overview

Mirra takes a single product description (for example: "VR fitness headset that gamifies workouts") and runs it through a multi-step analysis pipeline:

Generate Product Personas Creates 5–6 realistic consumer archetypes (for example: "Active Minimalist", "Adrenaline Junkie").

Filter Real Persona Data Searches through 2,000+ real persona vectors to find similar profiles.

Simulate Purchase Decisions Asks the model which personas would buy or reject the product.

Classify "Yes" Personas Groups them into meaningful archetypes such as "Trend-Driven Explorer".

Generate Insights Summarizes motivations, purchase intent, and reasoning for each persona.
